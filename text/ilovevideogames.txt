I love videogames, they mean a lot to me. Growing up as a kid I had a lot of challenges and I had a hard time dealing with stress and depression, and videogames always helped me relax and be happy. They helped me turn strong negative emotions and experiences into positive ones, they made me happy. I believe they saved my life and that's why I believe passionately in the power of videogames. Many people believe that videogames rot your brain away and are a waste of time, however I believe that they are a beautiful medium through which we can deliver beautiful stories and adventures. I believe there is so much to gain from letting out our creative side, our adventureous side, our competitive side in the world of videogames.
